        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="p1"> My name is Mina and I go to Wexford CSA. I created this website as a personal html/css project for the following year! 
            During the previous school year, I found it hard to know which areas I need to improve my grade in (e.g. KU, TI) withough a constant 
            stream of updates. This grades calculator will help me, and hopefully you :), know exactly which sections to focus more of your time on. Let us work hard and be more efficient together! </p>   
        </p>

        <p class="p2"> This website was created for #AthenaAward under Hack Club. The Athena Award is a program run by Hack Club for girls and gender 
            minorities looking to get into programming, coding, and building technical projects of any kind. This is the second of the three projects
             I am working towards for the Athena Award. </p>
