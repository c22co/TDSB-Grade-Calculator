Hi! This project is an HTML/CSS website. During the school year, I kept noticing the existing grades calculators are American GPA focused. 
In Toronto school boards, grades are calculated based off of 4 different categories with different weightings to each. I made this website to help me and other students who
were facing similiar problems! A couple things I struggled with were being able to make my design mobile friendly. Many images, texts, and symbols on mobile were in different
places where I would have wanted them to be in (lots of bugs..) But a good learning experience :) 

Features 
- Calculator
- About
- Symbols that are linked
